 <Description>
The intention of these function is to create stand-alone pdf and html files
using AutoDoc without having them associated to a package.
It uses the same optional records as the &AutoDoc; command itself, but instead of
a package name there should be a filename or a list of filenames containing AutoDoc
text from which the documents are created. Please see the &AutoDoc; command for more
information about this and have a look at <Ref Label="Tut:AutoDocWorksheet"/> for a simple worksheet example.
