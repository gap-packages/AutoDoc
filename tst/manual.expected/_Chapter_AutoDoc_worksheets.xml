 <Description>
  The intention of these function is to create stand-alone pdf and html files
  using AutoDoc without having them associated to a package.
  It uses the same optional records as the &AutoDoc; command itself, but instead of
  a package name there should be a filename or a list of filenames containing AutoDoc
  text from which the documents are created. Please see the &AutoDoc; command for more
  information about this and have a look at <Ref Label="Tut:AutoDocWorksheet"/> for a simple worksheet example.
