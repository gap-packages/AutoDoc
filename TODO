* why is an internal detail like AUTOMATIC_DOCUMENTATION documented?
  at most, it should be part of the "developers documentation".

* DeclareAttributeWithDocumentation does not support all arguments DeclareAttribute supports.
  Same for some of the others.
  Possible solution: Change the signature of DeclareAttributeWithDocumentation to accept
  as first param a list; this list will then be used to call DeclareAttribute.

* Why does AutoDoc force the user to replace spaces by underscores in chapter_and_section?
  I mean, it later translates those underscores to spaces in some places... so why not reverse
  the logic, and allow the user to use spaces... then replace those by underscores when needed.

* Why is chapter_and_section not just an entry of the options record?

* For that matter, have you looked into using ValueOption etc. instead of an option record?

* Perhaps add a tool which allows extracting TODO / FIXME comments from the code, collecting
  them, together with nice links to the relevant code sections. Think "doxygen for GAP".
  Indeed, in the ultimate version, this would also generate a HTML file for each GAP source file,
  with a nice syntax highlighted version of the GAP code, line numbers etc., so that documentation
  can directly link to each defined function... hui... :)
