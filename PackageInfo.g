##  PackageInfo.g for the package `ToolsForHomalg'         Mohamed Barakat
##  (created from Frank Lübeck's PackageInfo.g template file)
##  

##  For the LoadPackage mechanism in GAP >= 4.4 only the entries
##  .PackageName, .Version, .PackageDoc, .Dependencies, .AvailabilityTest
##  .Autoload   are needed. The other entries are relevant if the
##  package shall be distributed for other GAP users, in particular if it
##  shall be redistributed via the GAP Website.

##  With a new release of the package at least the entries .Version, .Date and
##  .ArchiveURL must be updated.

SetPackageInfo( rec(

##  This is case sensitive, use your preferred spelling.
#
PackageName := "AutoDoc",

##  This may be used by a default banner or on a Web page, should fit on
##  one line.
Subtitle := "Tools for generating automatic GAPDoc documentations",

##  See '?Extending: Version Numbers' in GAP help for an explanation
##  of valid version numbers. For an automatic package distribution update
##  you must provide a new version number even after small changes.
Version := Maximum( [
## this line prevents merge conflicts
  "2012.09.09", ## Sebas' version
] ),
##  Please adjust also the VERSION file in the package directory when
##  changing this.

##  Release date of the current version in dd/mm/yyyy format.
# 
# this avoids git-merge conflicts
Date := ~.Version{[ 1 .. 10 ]},
Date := Concatenation( ~.Date{[ 9, 10 ]}, "/", ~.Date{[ 6, 7 ]}, "/", ~.Date{[ 1 .. 4 ]} ),

##  URL of the archive(s) of the current package release, but *without*
##  the format extension(s), like '.zoo', which are given next.
##  The archive file name *must be changed* with each version of the archive
##  (and probably somehow contain the package name and version).
##  The paths of the files in the archive must begin with the name of the
##  directory containing the package (in our "example" probably:
##  example/init.g, ...    or  example-1.3/init.g, ...  )
# 
ArchiveURL := Concatenation( "http://wwwb.math.rwth-aachen.de/~gutsche/gap_packages/AutoDoc/AutoDoc-", ~.Version ),

##  All provided formats as list of file extensions, separated by white
##  space or commas.
##  Currently recognized formats are:
##      .zoo       the (GAP-traditional) zoo-format with "!TEXT!" comments 
##                 for text files
##      .tar.gz    the UNIX standard
##      .tar.bz2   compressed with 'bzip2', often smaller than with gzip
##      -win.zip   zip-format for DOS/Windows, text files must have DOS 
##                 style line breaks (CRLF)
##  
##  In the future we may also provide .deb or .rpm formats which allow
##  a convenient installation and upgrading on Linux systems.
##  
# ArchiveFormats := ".zoo", # the others are generated automatically
ArchiveFormats := ".tar.gz",

##  If not all of the archive formats mentioned above are provided, these 
##  can be produced at the GAP side. Therefore it is necessary to know which
##  files of the package distribution are text files which should be unpacked
##  with operating system specific line breaks. There are the following 
##  possibilities to specify the text files:
##  
##    - specify below a component 'TextFiles' which is a list of names of the 
##      text files, relative to the package root directory (e.g., "lib/bla.g")
##    - specify below a component 'BinaryFiles' as list of names, then all other
##      files are taken as text files.
##    - if no 'TextFiles' or 'BinaryFiles' are given and a .zoo archive is
##      provided, then the files in that archive with a "!TEXT!" comment are
##      taken as text files
##    - otherwise: exactly the files with names matching the regular expression
##      ".*\(\.txt\|\.gi\|\.gd\|\.g\|\.c\|\.h\|\.htm\|\.html\|\.xml\|\.tex\|\.six\|\.bib\|\.tst\|README.*\|INSTALL.*\|Makefile\)"
##      are taken as text files
##  
##  (Remark: Just providing a .tar.gz file will often result in useful
##  archives)
##  
##  These entries are *optional*.
#TextFiles := ["init.g", ......],
#BinaryFiles := ["doc/manual.dvi", ......],


##  Information about authors and maintainers. Specify for each person a 
##  record with the following information:
##  
##     rec(
##     # these are compulsory, characters are interpreted as latin-1, so
##     # German umlauts and other western European special characters are ok:
##     LastName := "Müller",
##     FirstNames := "Fritz Eduard",
##  
##     # At least one of the following two entries must be given and set 
##     # to 'true' (an entry can be left out if value is not 'true'):
##     IsAuthor := true;
##     IsMaintainer := true;
##  
##     # At least one of the following three entries must be given.
##     # - preferably email address and WWW homepage
##     # - postal address not needed if email or WWW address available
##     # - if no contact known, specify postal address as "no address known"
##     Email := "Mueller@no.org",
##     # complete URL, starting with protocol
##     WWWHome := "http://www.no.org/~Mueller",
##     # separate lines by '\n' (*optional*)
##     PostalAddress := "Dr. F. Müller\nNo Org Institute\nNo Place 13\n\
##     12345 Notown\nNocountry"
##     
##     # If you want, add one or both of the following entries (*optional*)
##     Place := "Notown",
##     Institution := "Institute for Nothing"
##     )
##  
Persons := [
  rec(
    LastName      := "Gutsche",
    FirstNames    := "Sebastian",
    IsAuthor      := true,
    IsMaintainer  := true,
    Email         := "sebastian.gutsche@rwth-aachen.de",
    WWWHome       := "http://wwwb.math.rwth-aachen.de/~gutsche/",
    PostalAddress := Concatenation( [
                       "Sebastian Gutsche\n",
                       "Lehrstuhl B fuer Mathematik, RWTH Aachen\n",
                       "Templergraben 64\n",
                       "52062 Aachen\n",

    Place         := "Aachen",
    Institution   := "RWTH Aachen University"
  ),
# provide such a record for each author and/or maintainer ...
  
],

##  Status information. Currently the following cases are recognized:
##    "accepted"      for successfully refereed packages
##    "deposited"     for packages for which the GAP developers agreed 
##                    to distribute them with the core GAP system
##    "dev"           for development versions of packages 
##    "other"         for all other packages
##
# Status := "accepted",
Status := "deposited",

##  You must provide the next two entries if and only if the status is 
##  "accepted" because is was successfully refereed:
# format: 'name (place)'
# CommunicatedBy := "Mike Atkinson (St. Andrews)",
#CommunicatedBy := "",
# format: mm/yyyy
# AcceptDate := "08/1999",
#AcceptDate := "",

##  For a central overview of all packages and a collection of all package
##  archives it is necessary to have two files accessible which should be
##  contained in each package:
##     - A README file, containing a short abstract about the package
##       content and installation instructions.
##     - The PackageInfo.g file you are currently reading or editing!
##  You must specify URLs for these two files, these allow to automate 
##  the updating of package information on the GAP Website, and inclusion
##  and updating of the package in the GAP distribution.
#
README_URL := 
  "http://wwwb.math.rwth-aachen.de/~gutsche/gap_packages/AutoDoc/README.AutoDoc",
PackageInfoURL := 
   "http://wwwb.math.rwth-aachen.de/~gutsche/gap_packages/AutoDoc/PackageInfo.g",

##  Here you  must provide a short abstract explaining the package content 
##  in HTML format (used on the package overview Web page) and an URL 
##  for a Webpage with more detailed information about the package
##  (not more than a few lines, less is ok):
##  Please, use '<span class="pkgname">GAP</span>' and
##  '<span class="pkgname">MyPKG</span>' for specifing package names.
##  
# AbstractHTML := "This package provides  a collection of functions for \
# computing the Smith normal form of integer matrices and some related \
# utilities.",
#AbstractHTML := 
#  "The <span class=\"pkgname\">Example</span> package, as its name suggests, \
#   is an example of how to create a <span class=\"pkgname\">GAP</span> \
#   package. It has little functionality except for being a package",

##  Here is the information on the help books of the package, used for
##  loading into GAP's online help and maybe for an online copy of the 
##  documentation on the GAP website.
##  
##  For the online help the following is needed:
##       - the name of the book (.BookName)
##       - a long title, shown by ?books (.LongTitle, optional)
##       - the path to the manual.six file for this book (.SixFile)
##       - a decision if the book should be (auto)loaded, probably 'true'
##         (.Autoload)
##  
##  For an online version on a Web page further entries are needed, 
##  if possible, provide an HTML- and a PDF-version:
##      - if there is an HTML-version the path to the start file,
##        relative to the package home directory (.HTMLStart)
##      - if there is a PDF-version the path to the .pdf-file,
##        relative to the package home directory (.PDFFile)
##      - give the paths to the files inside your package directory
##        which are needed for the online manual (either as URL .Archive
##        if you pack them into a separate archive, or as list 
##        .ArchiveURLSubset of directory and file names which should be 
##        copied from your package archive, given in .ArchiveURL above
##  
##  For links to other GAP or package manuals you can assume a relative 
##  position of the files as in a standard GAP installation.
##  
# in case of several help books give a list of such records here:
PackageDoc := rec(
  # use same as in GAP            
  BookName  := "AutoDoc",
  # format/extension can be one of .zoo, .tar.gz, .tar.bz2, -win.zip
  ArchiveURLSubset := ["doc"],
  HTMLStart := "doc/chap0.html",
  PDFFile   := "doc/manual.pdf",
  # the path to the .six file used by GAP's help system
  SixFile   := "doc/manual.six",
  # a longer title of the book, this together with the book name should
  # fit on a single text line (appears with the '?books' command in GAP)
  # LongTitle := "Elementary Divisors of Integer Matrices",
  LongTitle := "Tools for generating automatic documentation",
  # Should this help book be autoloaded when GAP starts up? This should
  # usually be 'true', otherwise say 'false'. 
  Autoload  := false
),


##  Are there restrictions on the operating system for this package? Or does
##  the package need other packages to be available?
Dependencies := rec(
  # GAP version, use version strings for specifying exact versions,
  # prepend a '>=' for specifying a least version.
  GAP := ">=4.4",
  # list of pairs [package name, (least) version],  package name is case
  # insensitive, least version denoted with '>=' prepended to version string.
  # without these, the package will not load
  NeededOtherPackages := [ [ "GAPDoc", ">= 1.0" ] ],
  # without these the package will issue a warning while loading
  # SuggestedOtherPackages := [],
  SuggestedOtherPackages := [ ],
  # needed external conditions (programs, operating system, ...)  provide 
  # just strings as text or
  # pairs [text, URL] where URL  provides further information
  # about that point.
  # (no automatic test will be done for this, do this in your 
  # 'AvailabilityTest' function below)
  # ExternalConditions := []
  ExternalConditions := []
                      
),

##  Provide a test function for the availability of this package.
##  For packages which will not fully work, use 'Info(InfoWarning, 1,
##  ".....")' statements. For packages containing nothing but GAP code,
##  just say 'ReturnTrue' here.
##  With the new package loading mechanism (GAP >=4.4)  the availability
##  tests of other packages, as given under .Dependencies above, will be 
##  done automatically and need not be included in this function.
#AvailabilityTest := ReturnTrue,
AvailabilityTest := function()
    return true;
  end,

##  The LoadPackage mechanism can produce a default banner from the info
##  in this file. If you are not happy with it, you can provide a string
##  here that is used as a banner. GAP decides when the banner is shown and
##  when it is not shown. *optional* (note the ~-syntax in this example)
BannerString := Concatenation( 
  "----------------------------------------------------------------\n",

  "  ?AutoDoc:x       ## for chapter/section/topic x\n",
  "----------------------------------------------------------------\n" ),

##  Suggest here if the package should be *automatically loaded* when GAP is 
##  started.  This should usually be 'false'. Say 'true' only if your package 
##  provides some improvements of the GAP library which are likely to enhance 
##  the overall system performance for many users.
Autoload := false,

##  *Optional*, but recommended: path relative to package root to a file which 
##  contains as many tests of the package functionality as sensible.

##  of the package.
