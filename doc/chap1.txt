  [33X[0;0Y[5XAutoDoc[105X  is  a  [5XGAP[105X  package  which  is meant to aide [5XGAP[105X package authors in
  creating and maintaing the documentation of their packages. In this capacity
  it  builds  upon [5XGAPDoc[105X (and hence is not a replacement for it, but rather a
  complement).  In  this  chapter  we  describe  how you can get started using
  [5XAutoDoc[105X  for your package. To this end, we will assume from now on that your
  package is called [5XSomePackage[105X.[133X
  
  
  [1X1.1 [33X[0;0YCreating a package manual from scratch[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YSuppose  your  package  is already up and running, but so far has no manual.
  Then  you  can  rapidly  generate  a [21Xscaffold[121X for a package manual using the
  [2XAutoDoc[102X  ([14X4.1-1[114X)  command  like  this,  while  running  [5XGAP[105X from within your
  package's directory (the one containing the [11XPackageInfo.g[111X:[133X
  
  [4X[32X[104X
    [4XLoadPackage( "AutoDoc" );[104X
    [4XAutoDoc( : scaffold := true );[104X
  [4X[32X[104X
  
  [33X[0;0YThis  first  reads  the  [11XPackageInfo.g[111X  file  from the current directory. It
  extracts  information  about  package from it (such as its name and version,
  see  Section  [14X1.5[114X).  It  then  creates two XML files [11Xdoc/SomePackage.xml[111X and
  [11Xdoc/title.xml[111X insider the package directory. Finally, it runs [5XGAPDoc[105X on them
  to produce a nice initial PDF and HTML version of your fresh manual.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YTo  ensure that the [5XGAP[105X help system picks up your package manual, you should
  also add something like the following to your [11XPackageInfo.g[111X:[133X
  
  [4X[32X[104X
    [4XPackageDoc := rec([104X
    [4X  BookName  := ~.PackageName,[104X
    [4X  ArchiveURLSubset := ["doc"],[104X
    [4X  HTMLStart := "doc/chap0.html",[104X
    [4X  PDFFile   := "doc/manual.pdf",[104X
    [4X  SixFile   := "doc/manual.six",[104X
    [4X  LongTitle := ~.Subtitle,[104X
    [4X),[104X
  [4X[32X[104X
  
  [33X[0;0YCongratulations, your package now has a minimal working manual. Of course it
  will  be  mostly  empty  for  now, but it already should contain some useful
  information,  based  on  the  data in your [11XPackageInfo.g[111X. This includes your
  package's  name,  version  and  description as well as information about its
  authors.  And  if you ever change the package data, (e.g. because your email
  address  changed),  just re-run the above command to regenerate the two main
  XML files with the latest information.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YNext  of  course  you need to provide actual content (unfortunately, we were
  not  yet  able  to  automate  [13Xthat[113X  for  you,  more  research  on artificial
  intelligence  is  required).  To add more content, you have several options:
  You  could  add further [5XGAPDoc[105X XML files containing extra chapters, sections
  and  so on. Or you could use classic [5XGAPDoc[105X source comments (in either case,
  see  Section [14X1.3[114X on how to teach the [2XAutoDoc[102X ([14X4.1-1[114X) command to include this
  extra  documentation). Or you could use the special documentation facilities
  [5XAutoDoc[105X provides (see Section [14X1.2[114X).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YYou  may  also  wish  to  consult  Section  [14X1.4[114X  for  hints on automatically
  re-generating your package manual when necessary.[133X
  
  
  [1X1.2 [33X[0;0YDocumenting code with [5XAutoDoc[105X[101X[1X[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YTo  get  one of your global functions, operations, attributes etc. to appear
  in  the  package  manual,  simply  insert  an [5XAutoDoc[105X comment of the form [10X#![110X
  directly in front of it. For example:[133X
  
  [4X[32X[104X
    [4X#![104X
    [4XDeclareOperation( "ToricVariety", [ IsConvexObject ] );[104X
  [4X[32X[104X
  
  [33X[0;0YThis  tiny change is already sufficient to ensure that the operation appears
  in  the  manual.  In general, you will want to add further information about
  the operation, such as in the following example:[133X
  
  [4X[32X[104X
    [4X#! @Arguments conv[104X
    [4X#! @Returns a toric variety[104X
    [4X#! @Description[104X
    [4X#!  Creates a toric variety out[104X
    [4X#!  of the convex object <A>conv</A>.[104X
    [4XDeclareOperation( "ToricVariety", [ IsConvexObject ] );[104X
  [4X[32X[104X
  
  [33X[0;0YFor  a  thorough  description  of what you can do with [5XAutoDoc[105X documentation
  comments, please refer to chapter [14X2[114X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YSuppose  you  have not been using [5XGAPDoc[105X before but instead used the process
  described  in  section  [14X1.1[114X  to  create  your manual. Then the following [5XGAP[105X
  command  will  regenerate  the  manual  and  automatically include all newly
  documented functions, operations etc.:[133X
  
  [4X[32X[104X
    [4XLoadPackage( "AutoDoc" );[104X
    [4XAutoDoc( : scaffold := true, autodoc := true );[104X
  [4X[32X[104X
  
  [33X[0;0YIf  you are not using the scaffolding feature, e.g. because you already have
  an   existing   [5XGAPDoc[105X   based  manual,  then  you  can  still  use  [5XAutoDoc[105X
  documentation  comments.  Just  make sure to first edit the main XML file of
  your documentation, and insert the line[133X
  
  [4X[32X[104X
    [4X#Include SYSTEM "_AutoDocMainFile.xml"[104X
  [4X[32X[104X
  
  [33X[0;0Yin  a  suitable  place.  This  means  that you can mix [5XAutoDoc[105X documentation
  comment freely with your existing documentation; you can even still make use
  of  any  existing  [5XGAPDoc[105X documentation comments in your code. The following
  command  should  be  useful for you in this case; it still scans the package
  code  for [5XAutoDoc[105X documentation comments and the runs [5XGAPDoc[105X to produce HTML
  and PDF output, but does not touch your documentation XML files otherwise.[133X

  [33X[0;0YEven  if you already have an existing [5XGAPDoc[105X manual, it might be interesting
  for you to use [5XAutoDoc[105X for two purposes:[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YFirst off, with [5XAutoDoc[105X is very convenient to regenerate your documentation.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YSecondly,  the  scaffolding feature which generates a title package with all
  the  metadata  of  your package in a uniform way is very handy. The somewhat
  tedious  process  of keeping your title page in sync with your [11XPackageInfo.g[111X
  is  fully  automated  this way (including the correct version, release data,
  author information and so on).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThere  are various examples of packages using [5XAutoDoc[105X for only this purpose,
  e.g. [5XIO[105X and [5Xorb[105X.[133X
  
  
  [1X1.4 [33X[0;0YAutomatic regeneration of the manual[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YYou  will  probably  want  to re-run the [2XAutoDoc[102X ([14X4.1-1[114X) command frequently,
  e.g. whenever you modified your documentation or your [11XPackageInfo.g[111X. To make
  this  more  convenient and reproducible, we recommend putting its invocation
  into  a  file [11Xmakedoc.g[111X in your package directory, with content based on the
  following example:[133X
  
  [4X[32X[104X
    [4XLoadPackage( "AutoDoc" );[104X
    [4XAutoDoc( : autodoc := true );[104X
    [4XQUIT;[104X
  [4X[32X[104X
  
  [33X[0;0YThen  you  can  regenerate the package manual from the command line with the
  following command, executed from within in the package directory:[133X
  
  [4X[32X[104X
    [4Xgap makedoc.g[104X

  [33X[0;0Y[5XAutoDoc[105X  can  extract  data  from [11XPackageInfo.g[111X in order to generate a title
  page.  Specifically, the following components of the package info record are
  looked at:[133X
  
  [8XVersion[108X
        [33X[0;6YThis  is used to set the [10X<Version>[110X element of the title page, with the
        string [21XVersion [121X prepended.[133X
  
  [8XDate[108X
        [33X[0;6YThis is used to set the [10X<Date>[110X element of the title page.[133X
  
  [8XSubtitle[108X
        [33X[0;6YThis  is  used  to  set  the [10X<Subtitle>[110X element of the title page (the
        [10X<Title>[110X is set to the package name).[133X
  
  [8XPersons[108X
        [33X[0;6YThis  is  used  to  generate  [10X<Author>[110X elements in the generated title
        page.[133X
  
  [8XPackageDoc[108X
        [33X[0;6YThis  is a record (or a list of records) which is used to tell the [5XGAP[105X
        help  system  about the package manual. Currently [5XAutoDoc[105X extracts the
        value  of the [10XPackageDoc.BookName[110X component and then passes that on to
        [5XGAPDoc[105X when creating the HTML, PDF and text versions of the manual.[133X
  
  [8XAutoDoc[108X
        [33X[0;6YThis  is  a  record  which  can  be  used  to  control the scaffolding
        performed  by  [5XAutoDoc[105X,  specifically to provide extra information for
        the  title  page. For example, you can set [10XAutoDoc.TitlePage.Copyright[110X
        to  a  string which will then be inserted on the generated title page.
        Using this method you can customize the following title page elements:
        [10XTitleComment[110X, [10XAbstract[110X, [10XCopyright[110X, [10XAcknowledgements[110X and [10XColophon[110X.[133X
  
        [33X[0;6YNote   that   [10XAutoDoc.TitlePage[110X   behaves  exactly  the  same  as  the
        [10Xscaffold.TitlePage[110X parameter of the [2XAutoDoc[102X ([14X4.1-1[114X) function.[133X
