<Heading>Integrating &AutoDoc; into your existing documentation</Heading>

Suppose you already have a package, let's name it <C>Harald</C>, and <C>Harald</C> already has some documentation.
But from now on you want to get rid of always writing xml. Then you can use &AutoDoc; to write your new documentation parts.
All you need is to follow those simple steps, to include &AutoDoc; generated documentation in <C>Harald</C>s already existing documentation.

 <List>
   <Item>
  Step 1:
    Declare the new objects with the <C>Declare*WithDocumentation</C> methods and add the descriptions like this:

<Verb>
DeclareCategoryWithDocumentation( "ACategory",
                                  IsObject,
                                  "A test.",
                                  [ "With_chapter_info", "Category_section" ] );
</Verb>
</Item>

  <Item>
  Step 2:
    Launch the AutoDoc command with arguments <C>Harald</C> and the path of your documentation. If you want to,
    you can also enable &GAPDoc; in the command.
    
<Verb>
LoadPackage("AutoDoc");

AutoDoc(
    "Harald",
    rec(
        dir := "doc/",     # default
        scaffold := false,  # implied by existence of PackageInfo.AutoDoc
        autodoc := rec(
            output := "gap/AutoDocEntries.g",
            entities := [],
        )
    )
);
</Verb>
</Item>

  <Item>
  Step 3:
    Step 2 should have created, among other files, a file named AutoDocMainFile.xml in your documentation folder. Include this file in your documentation via

<Verb>
#Include SYSTEM "AutoDocMainFile.xml"
</Verb>
</Item>

</List>

  Now you should have your &AutoDoc; created data in your documentation. Have fun with it.
